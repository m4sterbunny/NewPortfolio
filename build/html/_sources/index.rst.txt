---------

This site acts as a showcase for my technical writing.


Static Site Skills
******************

This site is written in reStructured Text (rST) which is rendered as HTML.

The :doc:`portfolio <pages/portfolio>` includes links to a Slate site, which uses markdown to render HTML on GitHub pages. This achieves several objectives:
1) It demonstrates that I can handle static site builders solo (no team here!).
2) The site consumes API data and displays that in a user-friendly manner (more user friendly than current read the docs offerings!).
4) It protects past clients' sensitive information.

Most customers I work with in documentation projects prefer tools that consume files in Markdown and, for APIs, YAML/Markdown blends. I tend to simply use my favorite notepad tool, Sublime to work the docs.

I work like a dev: I push and pull to GitHub *et al*. I collaborate on reviews on PRs.

I like to hack documentation management by applying metadata/front matter to files. This way, the file manages itself.
