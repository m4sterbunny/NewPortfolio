.. topic:: Note

  While I attempt to link to API documents that I edited/approved directly, the companies maintain a living document that may have endpoints that I have not handled. Similarly, documentation may be built out after my engagement is completed.


Developer Documentation
***********************

While most of the developer docs I have been responsible for are also API docs, this is not always the case. See my :ref:`Web3 dev docs <developerdocs>` for more on the blockchain-specific dev portals.

The challenge with Web3 docs on token-floated projects is that there is often a need to accommodate retail as well as developer audiences. While in the Web2 world, there is a clear separation between retail/user docs and developer portals.

Video Documentation
*******************

Not everyone wants to read, some folk want to see the action. To support this, I use Techsmith's Camtasia and some Jabra headphones. The sound quality would be much better if anyone gave me a recording budget. One day!

For Neon EVM, I created a "retail" video series for our mostly-developer based audience:

- `Get Started <https://youtu.be/0rK2Oonigik>`_
- `Validate transactions with blockchain explorers <https://youtu.be/tNXRDBmtOPQ>`_
- `Create an NFT collection with thirdweb <https://youtu.be/lXjtSQhj4Cc>`_

Similarly, for Panther Protocol, I created a "retail" video series for our mostly-developer based audience to introduce our testnet dApp:

Editing
*******

.. topic:: Note

  For Web3-related editing, see the :ref:`Web3 edits <web3editor>` section in the blockchain-focused page.

Clients often have internal subject matter experts who write and need an edit/proof to improve the copy prior to it going public.

Alternatively, clients create cross-over projects along the lines of: "would you also be able to take a look at ...".

   * - SWIAT
     - SWIAT serves the Capital Banking system: a system that is desperate to invest and utilize crypto, but is firmly lodged in older tech. The creative minds at SWIAT came up with a way to hack an atomic swap onchain facilitated by the SWIFT system. They needed an editor for the paper.
     - `PDF of the paper <https://www.swiat.io/media/swiat_cycros_whitepaper.pdf>`_


With a Ph.D. in Biology and an undergraduate degree in parasitology, I guess it is no surprise that Daniel from `Parasites without Borders <http://parasiteswithoutborders.com/books/>`_ reached out to ask me to edit in the medical field.

This book_ edit of Parasitic Diseases was, unusually, in my field of expertise. It also required that I recruit and manage a linguist for a pronunciation guide and assist Daniel with the clinical appendix (a new item for Edition 7 of this text). Also, I took on responsibility for indexing; this required that identifying and consolidating duplicates. When we, quite literally, ground InDesign's indexing option to a halt, I identified an alternative that consumed the PDF. Despite being a supported, paid-for option, it did not provide all the functionality we required. Therefore, I recruited someone with Python skills to customize a couple of scripts for us to provide the outcome we needed -- all in all, a great experience.

I am the editor for several PhDs and papers in the Biology sphere. This is where I cut my editorial teeth before I became focused on technical writing -- for example, this paper_ in pharmacology.

I was also involved in the NGO sector in South Africa. Here I assisted with research_ and editing_: especially the editing of data-driven reports.


Content Pipelines
*****************

Dividing my competencies into writing vs. editing is a massive oversimplification of what I do.

I have two clients, for example, for whom I was a key part of the content pipeline. That means I may have been given an article to write, or I suggest an article relevant to their needs. Alternatively, I might write the major part and then hand it off to an internal SME when I reach my tech threshold. After which, I become the editor for the piece.

So, some articles I will have written for them, others I edited, and others, both! In some instances, I did both and then brought multiple articles together to form a long-form white paper or e-book.

Sometimes I am the source of the content ideation. Or, I am the one who knows the past articles so well, that an editing round becomes partly an SEO round.

The lines get a little blurry sometimes, yes?

Both ecens_ and Finout_ fall into this category of role blurring, and, one way or another, I touched most of the content on their sites in my time with them.

.. _UserDocumentation:

User Documentation
******************

Of all the material I create, user documentation is probably the most likely not to be publicly accessible. For example, I created `Pathfinder <https://www.gilytics.com/pathfinder-platform>`_ SAAS documentation in rST (restructured text), making use of the glossary feature offered by Read the Docs. 

For ProofJump, I provided `annotated screenshots and detailed the function of various toolsets <https://proofjump.com/resources/docs/>`_.

The Allelica_ SaaS documentation is exposed from my account (with permission). It was written in Markdown in GitBook:

I often create high-level documentation to assist user understanding of the use cases for the API specification that I have created or edited: such as this `high-level documentation for Algopix <Algopix_HighLevel_>`_, and the user guide for Skyway_.

Not only do I create user guides from scratch, but I also assist with editing the existing documents:

   * -
     - StarkNet leverages Stark's own language Cairo which allows users to demonstrate "proof" of a valid submission to a blockchain such as Ethereum. I edited a section of the existing documentation (written in reStructured text).
     - Cairo_
   * - Braze
     - Braze provides a full-service marketing SaaS. They needed someone to update their documentation to align it with their new style guide (written in Markdown).
     - Braze_
   * - `ProofJump <https://proofjump.com/index.php>`_
     - I separated the Navigation pages from the User Guides to ease the user journey through the documentation. Also, I updated the documentation to reflect the most recent version of the app. This included updating screenshots and User Guide flows.
     - `Documentation <https://proofjump.com/resources/docs/>`_

.. topic:: Note

  Documentation editing requires a careful touch. There may be existing style guides to apply or only an emergent style to extract, cement, and then apply. The existing structure, for example, may not be up for negotiation.

.. _InstallationGuide:

Installation Guides
-------------------

Simple installation how-tos are essential for the sanity of everyone, wouldn't you agree?! 

My first ever installation guide included proposed a rebranding to NetworQ_ from Networq. I see it stuck!

Several of my :ref:`Infura/MetaMask <consensys>` updates follow basic installations steps too.


.. _apiprojects:

API Projects
************

.. _algopixlink:

Project: Algopix
----------------

Algopix engaged me to provide high-level overviews and detailed API specs for their eCommerce comparison product.


.. _caredovelink:

Project: Caredove
-----------------

Caredove engaged me to assist developers to understand how to support the API specification aspect of their project (caredoveAPI_). Caredove supports Canadian healthcare providers with a referral management system. The repo was in GitLab, and the spec rendered in Stoplight using JSON files. The original writer had been handed Postman tests and constructed the spec from the JSON.

To ensure that I did not interfere with existing users of the documentation, and to take advantage of Stoplight's rendering of tags, I converted the JSON spec to a YAML file and worked that while retaining the JSON docs.

The YAML did not adhere to Open API 3.0 specification, so I used Spectral and Swagger's editor to identify issues and fix them. For example, one endpoint had multiple functions -- dependent upon the payload sent. I removed the previous writer's "fix" (to present the path twice, once with a trailing /) and provided links from the specification to high-level documentation to support the user in understanding how the endpoint functioned and what payloads to provide.

Once the YAML could be consumed and rendered by Stoplight, I built up what I called pseudo-schemas. These schemas reflected example JSON payloads for endpoints that were missing their specification details. The reason I called them pseudo-schemas on each PR is that I am not a dev; I am a writer and, as such, believe that these should be validated (ideally by mocking a request with them; I didn't have my own authentication).

I also mapped the relevant fields of these schemas back to the `FHIR specification <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html>`_ that an endpoint is compliant with.

.. _cloudrflink:

Project: Cloud RF
-----------------

`Cloud RF <https://cloudrf.com/mapping-mesh-networks/>`_ has the most specialized technical topic that I have covered thus far. Other API gigs were fairly unspecialised by comparison: e-commerce (Upstart), school administration (Faria), and email marketing (smtp2go). I do not, however, have radio mapping skills.

This knowledge challenge was not a barrier to my cleaning the API set and ensuring that it was compliant. It simply required a tighter coms cycle which we achieved using PR comments on GitHub.

I did, however, step away from the high-level documentation, which was initially going to be part of the gig, as my naivety in Radio propagation mapping meant I did not feel I was the best person to provide the high-level docs. I set up the documentation site structure and the page structure and populated the pages with the base information and links. This left the client in a position to complete the high-level documentation internally.

Cloud RFs API is `publicly available <https://cloudrf.com/documentation/developer/swagger-ui/#/>`_. Also I provided a brief introduction and describe a `Cloud RF endpoint <https://m4sterbunny.github.io/build/#client-1-cloud-rf>`_ on my demo 3-pane site.

.. _cybertonicalink:

Project: Cybertonica
--------------------

Cybertonica's API is private to their clients: for good reason. They are dealing in the world of threat analyses. I assisted with a high-level customer integration document for a REST and SOAP API pair that may be accessed directly from JS plugins.

After that, I assisted with the API for the Shopify dashboard that provides similar threat analyses.

Working under an NDA, I am not able to expose this project further.

.. _dairyvetslink:

Project: Dairy Vets
-------------------

Dairy Vets had a non-compliant API and were keen to get it to render in Redoc.ly. I worked it through Redoc.ly's linter (with the lint requirements customized to "minimal") until it was compliant enough to render. Where compromises were made to achieve this, I logged "conversations" on the PR in GitHub to prevent any issues from being dropped.

.. _distdevslink:

Project: Distributed Devs
-------------------------

Distributed Devs, a British team, engaged me to write up an API for handover to other development teams. I took a less formal approach to allow this to be a much smaller investment and kept all the details in the Readme of the related repositories. Pleased with my efficiencies, they engaged me in other projects, such as high-level architecture documentation for products supporting the insurance sector (applying AI tools on insurance claims). Again, I am under NDAs and can not expose more about this client.

.. _farialink:

Project: Faria
--------------

The largest API set that I have cleaned is for Faria, for whom I cleaned multiple APIs. There is no intention to make these API documents publicly available. I have, therefore, provided a brief introduction and the smallest possible `Faria endpoint specification <https://m4sterbunny.github.io/build/#client-3-faria>`_.

Faria's docs are now fully compliant and consistent (US English for the APIs, UK English for the high-level client support documentation: yes that is something I pushed back against, no I didn't win that one!).

.. _glassixlink:

Project: Glassix
----------------

`Glassix <https://docs.glassix.com/>`_ needed assistance breaking out the user guides from the API reference, and expanding those guides to better support the developer audience.

.. _moolalink:

.. Project: Moola
.. --------------

.. Moola supports several financial services products. While the API is currently for internal use only, they hope to market the product. I assisted in cleaning up the documentation by working with the Indian development team across Slack and GitHub.

.. _skywaylink:

Project: Skyway
---------------

Skyway_  Payments: I created the high-level documents, took the JSON descriptions of endpoints from confluence, and generated an Open API 3.0-compliant spec. In addition, I negotiated redesign of schemas and improved property names to simplify the API for the user.

.. _smtp2golink:

Project: SMTP2GO
----------------

SMTP2GO supports mass email marketing campaigns. Initially, the documentation site was built in Redoc.ly. I edited and augmented the existing specification by working directly with the YAML. The team then moved to the single-page site builder, Slate. I worked with the developers across Asana, Slack, and GitHub until we had the functionality the Product team required.

.. _upstartlink:

Project: Upstart Commerce
-------------------------

Upstart Commerce provides a complete eCommerce platform from sales, to returns. I cleaned up the YAML/Swagger to ensure that the API is described correctly and assists the user effectively. I also "proofed", i.e. I fixed those issues that affect quality, such as ensuring consistency of the English language variant and style applied. Those niggling queries such as "does boolean mean 1 or True?" were smoothed away with the application of types, defaults, and examples.

Upstart_ Commerce has its Open API 3.0 documentation publicly available. This is one of the larger API sets that I cleaned up. Working with the Ukrainian dev team across Slack, the docs are now fully compliant and consistent (US English).
