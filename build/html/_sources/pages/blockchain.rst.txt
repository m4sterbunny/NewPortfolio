Developer Docs
--------------

I was the lead or sole technical writer working with Product to build out the following developer documentation:

- `Qredo <https://developers.qredo.com>`_: MkDocs
- `Panther Protocol <https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs>`_: GitBook 

With Consensys, as part of a global tech writing team, I have supported:

Docs Editor
***********

For StarkWare, I edited large components of the StarkExV3_ documentation. Writing in Markdown; building in GitBook.

I have also refactored the Cairo_ docs for Starknet_; now, if only the devs would actually merge the PR! Writing in rST; building with Sphinx/Read the Docs.

For `TX Labs`_, I introduced how to request and assign service nodes. Writing in Markdown; building in GitBook.

For Ethereum's docs, I improved several pages, e.g. the description around reorgs (see `PR <https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/pull/3267>`_).
